    Just use let always

JS is a weakly typed language, the type of the variable isn't strictly defined and can change (purposfully or accdentally thought the script)
    solution- TypeScript (strongly typed version of JS)-> which gets complied into JS before being run 
            - or create an assertType function to test variables before using them 


types: null, undefined, array, object, string, integer, floating point, boolean
can leave something undefined or set it to undefined specifically 

typeof(variable) to find variable typed

    
    6.07
